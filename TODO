Usually a lot ;)

In particular:

in reliability_profile eliminate use of tmp file

new feature: constrain match-diff relative to given alignment (for realigning)
  interface:
    mlocarna: give alignment and difference to alignment
              --relative-max-diff-match=clustal-alignment-file
    locarna:  position specific intervals


clean up chaos with types size_type, pos_type

introduce proper use of namespace locarna
