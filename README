Locarna: LOCal Alignment of RNA

Copyright Sebastian Will, 2005, 2006


Align two RNA molecules in the way of PMfold. However, we filter the
structure-pairs by their probability in advance and thus increase
efficiency. The algorithm selects the highest scoring nested
structure of basepair-matches out of two crossing structures.

The score evaluates basepair-matches by the probabilites of the
two matched basepairs/arcs and a sequence contribution. For
remaining part sequence similarity is scored.

Complexity of the algorithm is O( n_1 n_2 |P_1| |P_2|)
