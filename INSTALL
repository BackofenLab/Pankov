Installation instructions for LocARNA
-------------------------------------

The installation of LocARNA follows the general scheme of
configure/make/make install. On most GNU/Linux and unix-like systems,
one installs the program by running the command sequence:

./configure [--prefix=<your/preferred/installation/path>]
make
make install


For non-standard installations, configure --help provides a list of
possible configuration options.


DEPENDENCIES:
------------
For full functionality, the package requires the Vienna RNA package,
which can be downloaded from

    http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/

The tool locarnate furthermore requires T-Coffee, which is available
from

   http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects_home_page/t_coffee_home_page.html



The exact dependencies and their installation paths can be controlled
by LocARNA-specific options and environment variables for configure:
