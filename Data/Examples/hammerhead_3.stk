#=GF CC   The hammerhead ribozyme is one of the smallest catalytic
#=GF CC   RNAs. These RNAs have an endonuclease function, and most
#=GF CC   often are autocatalytic. Structurally it is composed of
#=GF CC   three base paired helices, separated by short linkers of
#=GF CC   conserved sequence. These helices are called I, II and III.
#=GF CC   We have classified hammerhead ribozymes into three types
#=GF CC   based on which helix the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence
#=GF CC   join. This family are the type III hammerheads.
#=GF CC   The conserved uridine-turn links helix I
#=GF CC   to helix II and usually has the sequence CUGA.  Helix II and
#=GF CC   III are linked by a sequence CGAAA.  The cleavage reaction
#=GF CC   occurs between helix III and I, and is usually a C.
#=GF CC   Hammerhead ribozymes are found in plant viroids and other
#=GF CC   small replicating satellite RNA species.  Hammerhead
#=GF CC   ribozymes have been found in animals as well as plants.
#=GF CC   This family includes a couple of false matches currently
#=GF CC   these are EMBL:AC078923 and EMBL:BC050488. These animal
#=GF CC   sequences are not expected to be hammerhead ribozymes.
