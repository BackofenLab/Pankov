HOWTO: Drawing Reliability Profiles
===================================

One of the benefits of probabilistic alignment with LocARNA
(i.e. using LocARNA-P) is that probability profiles for alignments can
be generated, which show the confidence in each single alignment
column.  Here, the use of the script reliability-profile.pl for
generating reliability profile plots is explained.

As prerequisite for using the tool, you will need an installation of
the statistics package R in addition to the usual requirements for
LocARNA.

Producing reliability profile plots is usually done in two steps.

1) STEP
-------
Perform an alignment of a set of RNA sequences by mlocarna with
the --probabilistic option. mlocarna produces output in a target
directory. This directory contains, among other data, the information
of the reliability profile. (If you already have such an mlocarna
output directory, you may skip step 1.)

An example call will look like this

> mlocarna --probabilistic Examples/archaea.fa

It writes data to the directory Examples/archaea.out. [ Actually you
don't need to know: the sub-directory Examples/archaea.out/results/
and in particular Examples/archaea.out/results/result.bmreliability
contains the necessary information. ]

Together with the mandatory option --probabilistic you may use almost
all the other options of mlocarna for modifying your result and/or
controlling the behavior of mlocarna. Call mlocarna --man for a brief
overview.

2) STEP
-------
Call the tool reliability-profile.pl for predicting signals in the
reliability profile and drawing a plot of the profile output as pdf or
png file. [Note that the script currently assumes a working
installation of locarna somewhere in the execution path.]

In the most simple form call

> reliability-profile.pl <output directory>

which produces a pdf-file rel.pdf containing the plot. Furthermore,
the signal in the reliability profile is predicted and drawn as a
green line in the output.

In our example, one would call

> reliability-profile.pl Examples/archaea.out


Please call reliability-profile.pl [--help] for a list of all
available options.

First, one may turn off signal prediction by --dont-predict. (Usually, one
wants this for most alignments!)

The output format can be changed to "png", which is very useful for
graphics on web-pages and such. Use the option --output-format="png"
for that purpose.

Option --title, let's you include a title in the plot (inset top-left).


An argument --seqname can be given for specifying one of the sequences
aligned when producing <output directory> by its name (or part of its
name). Often there is a "sequence of interest" (suppose one is
aligning RNA from several organisms, often one of them is the
reference organism). If such a sequence name is specified, the profile
is projected to this sequence (i.e. columns with gap in this
sequence's row are delete).
With projection for example call

> reliability-profile.pl --seqname fruA Examples/archaea.out



Most other options control prediction and related output. Furthermore,
it's supported to give genomic offset (for x-values) and draw arbitrary
signals as lines on top of the profile.
