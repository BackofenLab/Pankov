  ABSTRACT = {The discoveries of microRNAs and riboswitches, among 
                  others, have shown functional RNAs to be biologically more 
                  important and genomically more prevalent than previously 
                  anticipated. We have developed a general comparative 
                  genomics method based on phylogenetic stochastic 
                  context-free grammars for identifying functional RNAs 
                  encoded in the human genome and used it to survey an 
                  eight-way genome-wide alignment of the human, chimpanzee, 
                  mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish 
                  genomes for deeply conserved functional RNAs. At a loose 
                  threshold for acceptance, this search resulted in a set of 
                  48,479 candidate RNA structures. This screen finds a large 
                  number of known functional RNAs, including 195 miRNAs, 62 
                  histone 3'UTR stem loops, and various types of known genetic 
                  recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions 
                  are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate 
                  selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs 
                  involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that 
                  form singletons or small functional RNA families of 
                  completely unknown function. While the rate of false 
                  positives in the overall set is difficult to estimate and is 
                  likely to be substantial, the results nevertheless provide 
                  evidence for many new human functional RNAs and present 
                  specific predictions to facilitate their further 
                  characterization.}

  ABSTRACT = {Today, RNA is well known to perform important
                  regulatory and catalytical function due to its
                  distinguished structure. Consequentially, structure
                  is conserved in evolution and state-of-the art RNA
                  multiple alignment algorithms consider structure as
                  well as sequence information. However, existing
                  tools neglect the important aspect of
                  locality. Notably, locality in RNA occurs as
                  similarity of subsequences as well as similarity of
                  only substructures. <p> We present a novel approach
                  for multiple alignment of RNAs that deals with both
                  kinds of locality. The approach extends LocARNA by
                  structural locality and delegates the construction
                  of multiple alignments to T-Coffee.  <p> The paper
                  systematically investigates structural locality in
                  known RNA families. Benchmarking multiple alignment
                  tools on structurally local families shows the need
                  for algorithmic support of this locality. The
                  improvement in accuracy in special cases is achieved
                  while staying competitive with state-of-the-art
                  alignment tools across the whole Bralibase.  <p>

  ABSTRACT = {RNAz is a widely used software package for de novo 
                  detection of structured noncoding RNAs in comparative 
                  genomics data. Four years of experience have not only 
                  demonstrated the applicability of the approach, but also 
                  helped us to identify limitations of the current 
                  implementation. RNAz 2.0 provides significant improvements 
                  in two respects: (1) The accuracy is increased by the 
                  systematic use of dinucleotide models. (2) Technical 
                  limitations of the previous version, such as the inability 
                  to handle alignments with more than six sequences, are 
                  overcome by increased training data and the usage of an 
                  entropy measure to represent sequence similarities. RNAz 2.0 
                  shows a significantly lower false discovery rate on a 
                  dinucleotide background model than the previous version. 
                  Separate models for structural alignments provide an 
                  additional way to increase the predictive power. RNAz is 
                  open source software and can be obtained free of charge at:

  abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence
  similarities that are sufficientto establish homology. In some cases, such as
  microRNAs, box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs
  that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist
  ofmultiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics
  and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative non-coding
  RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many ofthem, evidence for stabilizing
  selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least
  approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming
  majority of these hypo-thetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established
  families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach
  that is capable of extracting putative RNA classesfrom genome-wide surveys
  for structured RNAs. The LocARNA tool implements a novel variant of
  theSankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand
  candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive
  predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured
  ornon-conserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based
  clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seedalignments. Furthermore,
  we have applied it to a previously published set of 3332 predicted structured
  elements in the Ciona intestinalis genomes (Missal et al., Bioinformatics
  21(S2), i77-i78). In addition torecovering e.g. tRNAs as a structure-based
  class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and
  snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which
  to-date norepresentative has been experimentally characterized.}

  journal = {BMC Genomics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {406},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent experimental and computational studies have
  provided overwhelming evidence for a plethora of diverse transcripts that are
  unrelated to protein-coding genes. One subclass consists of those RNAs that
  require distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their biological
  function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns of sequence conservation
  characteristic for positive selection on RNA secondary structure.The
  deep-sequencing of 12 drosophilid species coordinated by the NHGRI provides
  an ideal data set of comparative computational approaches to determine those
  genomic loci that code for evolutionarily conserved RNA motifs. This class of
  loci includes the majority of the known small ncRNAs as well as structured
  RNA motifs in mRNAs. We report here on a genome-wide survey using RNAz.
  RESULTS: We obtain 16 000 high quality predictions among which we recover the
  majority of the known ncRNAs. Taking a pessimistically estimated false
  discovery rate of 40% into account, this implies that at least some ten
  thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show the hallmarks of stabilizing
  selection action of RNA structure, and hence are most likely functional at
  the RNA level. A subset of RNAz predictions overlapping with TRF1 and BRF
  binding sites [Isogai et al., EMBO J. 26: 79-89 (2007)], which are plausible
  candidates of Pol III transcripts, have been studied in more detail. Among
  these sequences we identify several "clusters" of ncRNA candidates with
  striking structural similarities. CONCLUSION: The statistical evaluation of
  the RNAz predictions in comparison with a similar analysis of vertebrate
  genomes [Washietl et al., Nat. Biotech. 23: 1383-1390 (2005)] shows that
  qualitatively similar fractions of structured RNAs are found in introns,
  UTRs, and intergenic regions. The intergenic RNA structures, however, are
  concentrated much more closely around known protein-coding loci, suggesting
  that flies have significantly smaller complement of independent structured
  ncRNAs compared to mammals.}

  protein coding genes in the human genome, comparable information is lacking
  for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). We present a comparative screen of vertebrate
  genomes for structural noncoding RNAs, which evaluates conserved genomic DNA
  sequences for signatures of structural conservation of base-pairing patterns
  and exceptional thermodynamic stability. We predict more than 30,000
  structured RNA elements in the human genome, almost 1,000 of which are
  conserved across all vertebrates. Roughly a third are found in introns of
  known genes, a sixth are potential regulatory elements in untranslated
  regions of protein-coding mRNAs and about half are located far away from any
  known gene. Only a small fraction of these sequences has been described
  previously. A comparison with recent tiling array data shows that more than
  40% of the predicted structured RNAs overlap with experimentally detected
  sites of transcription. The widespread conservation of secondary structure
  points to a large number of functional ncRNAs and cis-acting mRNA structures
  in the human genome.}

  approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure
  prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of
  aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It
  consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for RNA secondary structure
  conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a
  measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is
  normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can
  be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional RNA
  secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with
  high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is
  not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly
  faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be
  downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~wash/RNAz. We screened all alignments
  of length n > or = 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which
  compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous
  genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the
  known noncoding RNAs and cis-acting elements with high significance and found
  compelling evidence for many other conserved RNA secondary structures not
  described so far to our knowledge.}
